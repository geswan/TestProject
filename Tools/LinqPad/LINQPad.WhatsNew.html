	<h1>
		What&#39;s new in LINQPad</h1>
	<em id='LP4'>Note: A version of LINQPad is <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx">
		available that runs on .NET Framework 4.0.</a> This has an (almost) identical feature set to LINQPad
		2, but targets C# 4 and VB 9 and lets you access Framework 4.0 features (such as improved OData support). LINQPad
		4 is a separate product and is updated in parallel to LINQPad 2.</em>

	<h2>Version 2.42 / 4.42</h2>

		<p>Version 2.42 fixes a bug that could cause excessive round-tripping when dumping Entity Framework 4.0 objects.</p>

		<h3>Performance</h3>
		<p>
			This build features a number of significant internal changes to reduce memory consumption and improve performance.
		</p>

		<h3>Result Caching</h3>

		<p>LINQPad provides a new extension method called <b>Cache</b> for caching results between query runs. Cache() is 
		transparent and fluent, so you can insert it into existing queries without making further changes.</p>

		<p>To demonstrate, try running the following query, which downloads five web pages, and then tells you
		how many times the word 'Semaphore' appears in each page:
		</p>

		<pre>
var webPages = (
   from page in "default.aspx part2.aspx part3.aspx part4.aspx part5.aspx".Split()
   select new 
   {
      Uri = page,
      Text = new System.Net.WebClient().DownloadString ("http://albahari.com/threading/" + page)
   }
).Cache();
    
var query = from page in webPages
   select new 
   {
      page.Uri, 
      matches = Regex.Matches (page.Text, @"(?i)\b" + "semaphore" + @"\b").Count
   };

query.Dump();</pre>

		<p>Now change the word 'semaphore' to something else and re-run the query. Notice that it executes instantly - because we 
		called <b>Cache</b> on the slow-running portion of the query.</p>

		<p>You can call Cache() several times in a query to cache different result sets. LINQPad will allocate separate cache slots
		unless the results are identically typed, in which case you can call Cache with a string to specify a unique key.</p>

		<p>You can clear the cache at any time by clearing the query's AppDomain (Shift+F5).</p>

		<p>Cache() operates on (lazily-evaluated) IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;/IQueryable&lt;T&gt; expressions. When you cache something for
		the first time, it acts as though you were calling ToArray on the sequence, except it that also keeps a reference to the results
		in memory. When it runs again, it retrieves that reference instead of enumerating the input sequence.</p>

		<p>You can also cache non-lazy sequences (such as arrays) and other kinds of objects, via the Cache method on the Util class that
		accepts Func&lt;T&gt;. For example:</p>

		<pre>Customer c = Util.Cache (() => Customers.First());</pre>

		<h3>Output</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Results can now be displayed in data grids - either via the new button in the toolbar, or by clicking the new extenser arrow in a table header.
			The data grids impose no arbitrary limit on the number of rows that can be displayed and allow exporting to Excel (on the context menu). They also let you
			interactively 'walk' lazily loaded navigation properties by clicking on their hyperlinks.
			The grid formatting mode can also be used for non-data objects - there's no limit on the nesting depth because objects are materialized on
			demand. Grids show 'live' data, so if you Dump() an object to a grid, make changes to it and then Dump() it again,
			you'll see only the final version. (In contrast, the standard rich text results window takes a snapshot of the object graph each time you call Dump).</li>

			<li>You can now dump any WPF element or Windows Forms control and it will display in the output window. If you want more control over how it's displayed,
			instead use the static methods on the new PanelManager class. You can attach event handlers to the controls and interact with the controls after
			the query has finished.</li>

			<li>For users of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609">Reactive Framework</a>, you can now dump <strong>IObservable</strong>s and 
				watch the results change interactively with the new <strong>DumpLive</strong> extension method. (DumpLive 
				is implemented internally by dumping WPF elements.)</li>

			<li>There's a new <strong>Format</strong> button on the results window to control the expansion of nested object graphs.</li>

			<li><strong>New keyboard shortcuts</strong>: Pressing any of the navigation keys 
				(Left, Right, Up, Down, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End) with the <strong>Alt</strong> 
				key scrolls or navigates the output panels without leaving the code editor.</li>
			<li><strong>Util.ClearResults</strong>() clears the results window.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h3>Extensibility</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In <b>My Queries</b>, there's now a special query called <b>My Extensions</b> for writing extension methods (and other types)
			that are available to all queries.</li>

			<li>You can now write custom output visualizers in Windows Forms or WPF, simply by writing methods that dump controls or elements. Or, if you want
			more control, call <strong>PanelManager.DisplayControl</strong> or <strong>PanelManager.DisplayWpfElement</strong> 
			For instance, the following displays a WPF button (you'll
			need to import the appropriate assemblies and namespaces - press F4 or, if you 
			have autocompletion, click the smart tag that appears):

<pre>PanelManager.DisplayWpfElement (new Button { Content = "Button" });</pre>

			(There's also a method on PanelManager to display syntax-colored text.) <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/CustomVisualizers.aspx">Click here for full details on writing 
			and deploying custom visualizers</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Compatibility</h3>
	<p>LINQPad now supports:</p>
	<ul>		
		<li><b>Oracle databases</b> - go to Add Connection | View More Drivers</li>			
		<li>the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/gg585582">Microsoft DataFlow CTP</a> (you can .Dump() blocks for a live visualization)</li>
		<li>the <strong>async</strong> and <strong>await</strong> keywords, if you have installed either the Framework 4.5 beta or the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/gg316360">Async CTP</a></li>
		<li>custom <strong>IObservable</strong> implementations and IAsyncEnumerable (from Interactive Extensions) when dumped</li>
		<li>machines on which only the .NET 4 Client Profile is installed</li>
		<li><strong>Entity Framework 4.1 / 4.2 / 4.3</strong> for data contexts based on DbContext - click
			<strong>Add Connection</strong> and choose <strong>Entity Framework POCO</strong>. 
			ESQL and SQL queries also work for code-first connections.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Compiler</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>References that you add to the <b>My Extensions</b> query (bottom of <b>My Queries</b>) are available globally to all queries. Unlike with
		the <b>Set as default for new queries</b> option, if you change these global references later, the changes will apply to existing queries.</li>
		<li>LINQPad now has the concept of a <strong>plug-in folder</strong>. All DLLs and 
			EXEs that reside in the plug-in folder are automatically
		referenced by all queries. You can set the plug-in folder location in Edit | Preferences, Folders.</li>
		<li>Compiler warnings (and all errors) are now displayed when running a query.</li>
		<li>There's now a button in the status bar for toggling compiler optimizations.</li>
		<li>LINQPad now defines the <strong>LINQPAD</strong> symbol to assist with conditional compilation when pasting between LINQPad and Visual Studio.
			You can also add your own <strong>#define</strong> directives to C# queries (in statements 
			and program mode).</li>
		<li>In 'C# Program' mode, you can tell LINQPad to make any extra types that you define non-nested by defining the NONEST symbol.</li>
		<li>There's now an <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/beta.aspx">Any-CPU build for LINQPad 4.x</a>. This is useful
			if you have queries that require more than 3GB of RAM, or if you need to reference assemblies built only for X64.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h3>Execution Engine</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Any new threads that you create can now continue to Dump out results after a query's main thread has finished executing. This means
			that the following now works:
			<pre>   new Thread (() => "Hello from a thread".Dump()).Start();</pre>
			<pre>   Task.Factory.StartNew (() => "Hello from a task".Dump());</pre>
			In case your threads run wild, there's a new option on the Query menu to cancel all threads (<strong>Ctrl+Shift+F5</strong>).
		</li>
		<li>When querying a database, the connection string&#39;s <strong>Application Name</strong> 
			now includes the name of the query.</li>
		<li>LINQPad now tracks the execution of a query's main thread as it's running (in 'Statements' and 'Program' mode). You can toggle this feature on the Query menu.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Editor</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>There's a new <b>Copy Markdown</b> option on the Edit menu for pasting code into StackOverflow, and a <b>Paste as Escaped String</b>
		option for pasting strings as C# or VB literals.</li>
		<li>Line numbers in the editor is now an option (Edit | Preferences).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Other</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now hide/show the Explorer panels with 'X' icon on the menu (or Shift+F8)</li>
			<li>You can now arrange the results panel vertically via the new results menu (or Ctrl+F8)</li>
			<li>Alt+W displays a list of all open queries</li>
			<li>When you switch the query language to SQL, LINQPad updates the Schema Explorer to show SQL column
				names rather than CLR property names.</li>
			<li>Querying system information tables is supported in SQL Azure as well as SQL Server (go to Connection Properties).</li>
			<li>Queries can now prompt for passwords - and securely save them - by calling Util.GetPassword("password-name").
			Passwords are stored in the Local Application Data folder and are encrypted with the Windows Data Protection API. 
			You can change and delete passwords via a new option on the File menu.
			 </li>
			<li>If you're using SQL Server authentication and your password expires, LINQPad presents a dialog for changing
				your password. You can disable this dialog in Edit | Preferences | Advanced.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>
		Version 2.31 / 4.31</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have a <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/Premium.aspx">LINQPad Premium</a> license, you can now write
		queries that span multiple SQL Server databases - simply by control+dragging additional database(s) from the
		Schema Explorer into your query. To access those additional databases in your queries, use database.table notation
		(e.g., "Northwind.Regions.Take(100)"). You can also use the connection properties dialog to specify additional 
		databases - this dialog will also allow you to include databases from linked servers (linked servers must
		be set up in SQL Server by calling sp_addlinkedserver).</li>		
		<li>LINQPad now has an automatic recovery feature for unsaved queries in case of unexpected shutdown.</li>
		<li>Console.ReadLine can now be called in LINQPad, offering a simple means to prompt for data at runtime. You can also
		call <b>Util</b>.ReadLine, which is overloaded to accept prompt text and a default value. For example:
<pre>
Util.ReadLine ("Enter your name").Dump();
Util.ReadLine ("Enter your name", "Joe Bloggs".Dump();    // Default value of Joe Bloggs
</pre>
		There is also a generic overload of Util.ReadLine that returns <i>typed</i> data:
<pre>
int age = Util.ReadLine<b>&lt;int&gt;</b> ("Enter your age");
</pre>
		Any primitive type will work - as will any type for which a Type Converter is present. Supplying a default
		value allows the compiler to infer the type parameter, so you can omit it:
<pre>
DateTime dt = Util.ReadLine ("Date of birth", DateTime.Now);
</pre>
		Nullable types are also supported, and a list of suggestions can be passed in the third parameter:
<pre>
int? age = Util.ReadLine&lt;int?&gt; ("Enter your age (optional)");
string name = Util.ReadLine ("Your favorite color", "", new[] { "Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue" });
</pre>		
		</li>
		<li>You can now query SQL Server system views and execute system stored procedures. Just go to the connection properties
		dialog and tick the new checkbox - you can then type "sys.sp_who()" or "INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES.Take(100)". System
		views and SPs are fully supported by autocompletion.</li>
		<li>Support for stored procedures has been improved in LINQPad 4: return values and output parameters are now displayed
		and optional parameters are enabled for all SP parameters. This means that you can omit parameters and use named arguments
		to specify just the values you want to pass:
<pre>
spFoo (date:DateTime.Now, historical:false)
</pre>
		In LINQPad 4, you can also use the new .AsDynamic method to query the DataSet returned from a stored procedure as
		though the DataSet was typed. For example:
<pre>
sys.sp_who2().<b>AsDynamic()</b>.Where (r => r.DBName == "master")
</pre>
		The AsDynamic method returns IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;. If a stored proc returns multiple result sets, you can access
		the additional result sets by specifying an index when calling AsDynamic.
		</li>
		<li>For autocompletion users, pressing F1 displays an Internet search of the type/member at the cursor. 
		Pressing Shift+F1 brings up the type/member in <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/">.NET Reflector</a>, loading
		the necessary assembly into Reflector if necessary.</li>
		<li>You can now display images in LINQPad's output by calling the Util.Image method or dumping a System.Drawing.Image object.
		When calling Util.Image, you can supply a byte array, filename, or URI. The latter can be used in conjunction with
		<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Chart API</a> to draw graphs. For example:
<pre>
Util.Image ("http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=s:Uf9a&chs=350x140&chl=January|February|March|April")
</pre>		
		outputs the following:<br />
		<img src='http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=s:Uf9a&chs=350x140&chl=January|February|March|April' />
		<br />
		LINQPad also now defines a .ToImage() extension method that operates on binary data, so you can go:
<pre>
Contacts.Select (c => new { c.Name, MugShot = c.Picture.ToImage() })
</pre>		
		</li>
		<li>You can now inject raw HTML into LINQPad's output by calling Util.RawHtml, passing in either a string or an XElement node.
		For instance:
<pre>
Util.RawHtml (new XElement ("h1", "This is a big heading")).Dump();
</pre>		
		</li>
		<li>There's a new toggle option on the Query menu to automatically scroll results to the end. This is useful in queries that
		progressively write data to the output window.</li>
		<li>You can now control LINQPad's progress bar by setting the Util.Progress property to a value between 0 and 100.</li>
		<li>The Export button in the results tab now has an 'Export to HTML' option.</li>
		<li>There's now (limited) support for the geometry, geography and hierarchyid types in SQL Server 2008. Columns of these types
		appear in result sets although you can't update them or use them to predicate queries (due to limitations in LINQ to SQL and
		Entity Framework).</li>
		<li>Reactive Framework works fully with F# queries. Commenting/uncommenting also now works in F# mode.</li>
		<li>Saving a query with as .SQL extension generates a file compatible with SSMS.</li>
		<li>Hyperlinks for associations between dbo tables and tables in other schemas now work.</li>
		<li>Queries defining classes with extension methods can now reference other classes in the query.</li>
		<li>You can access the current query's file path with Util.CurrentQueryPath.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Version 2.26 / 4.26</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This version of LINQPad explicitly supports <a href="https://www.sqlazureservices.com">Microsoft
			Dallas</a> - a repository of free and premium cloud data sources. Just click 'Add Connection' 
			and choose 'Microsoft Dallas'. This feature works best in <a href="http://www.linqpad.net">LINQPad 4.x</a>
			since LINQPad 4.x targets Framework 4.0 which has a newer OData API.</li>
		<li>
			You can now use LINQPad as an F# scratchpad: simply change the query language to
			'F# Expression' or 'F# Program', type in some F# code and hit F5! For more information,
			take a look at the F# tutorial in the samples tab (bottom left).</li>
		<li>You can now undock the results window into a second monitor by pressing F8 (Query
			Menu | Undock Results).</li>
		<li>The editor background color is now configurable in Edit | Preferences.</li>
		<li>Where appropriate, custom assembly references are now stored in the .LINQ file with
			both relative and absolute path information.</li>
		<li>You can now activate autocompletion via the command line as follows: <code>LINQPad.exe
			-activate=*code*</code></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0d2357ea-324f-46fd-88fc-7364c80e4fdb&displaylang=en">
			SQL CE 4.0 CTP</a> is now supported.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Version 2.20 / 4.20</h2>
	<p>
		Note: for a video demonstration of the new features in this release, take a look
		at the <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/Version2andBeyond.aspx">recent webcast</a>
		recording (jump to 22:00).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There's a new 'Navigate To' dialog (Ctrl+,) to quickly locate a query in your queries
			folder (or a sample). This is in addition to the 'Find All' option introduced in
			V2.10.</li>
		<li>The Dump() method lets you specify a maximum depth. This can be useful both for
			increasing and decreasing the default depth of 5.</li>
		<li>You can now give connections a custom name (right-click the connection and choose
			'Rename').</li>
		<li>Incremental search is now supported (Ctrl+I).</li>
		<li>When using Microsoft Reactive Framework, you can now Dump observable sequences directly.
			Calling Dump() on an observable sequence is non-blocking, so you can observe several
			sequences at once.</li>
		<li>If you associate LINQPad with .linq files, double-clicking a .linq file will re-use
			any existing instance of LINQPad.</li>
		<li>Shortcut keys for options such as commenting/uncommented have been aligned with
			VS2010. If you prefer the old shortcuts, you can re-enable them in Edit | Preferences.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This version also includes a number of autocompletion enhancements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Autocompletion lists come up as soon as you start typing. (If you don&#39;t like
			this feature, you can disable it in Edit | Preferences).</li>
		<li>Autocompletion lists are now filtered like in VS2010, so typing &#39;customer&#39;
			will filter the list to members that contain the word &#39;customer&#39; anywhere
			in their name. You can also type just the upper-case "humps" of a member - so typing
			tca will show ToCharArray.</li>
		<li>An option now appears in member lists to hide extensions methods. This is great
			when you want to browse just instance methods.</li>
		<li>Code snippets are fully supported. All of the standard VS C# snippets are included
			- plus a number of extras to help with LINQ queries. The shortcuts are listed on
			the Edit menu and are identical to VS2010 (including the ability to type the snippet's
			shortcut and then Tab). Any custom VS snippets in My Documents / Visual Studio 20XX
			/ Code Snippets / Visual C# are also imported automatically.</li>
		<li>With most query operators, you can press Tab from the member listing to insert a
			snippet for that operator.</li>
		<li>The dialog for adding references and namespaces (F4) includes a new button to save
			reference/namespace combinations to code snippets. You can then recall these combinations
			by typing the name of the snippet and Tab (or activating the Code Snippets listing
			from the Edit menu).</li>
		<li>When selecting into an anonymous type, an option appears to lets you select multiple
			items from member lists (the LINQPad 'power-tick'). This works even through parent
			associations.</li>
		<li>The smarttag for importing additional namespaces now works without having to first
			add a reference to an assembly. Just type 'new textbox', for example, and a smarttag
			will invite you to choose from all the TextBox types in the .NET Framework.</li>
		<li>Outlining and #region tags are supported for queries of type 'Program'.</li>
		<li>The autocompletion engine is faster with complex expressions.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Version 2.10 / 4.10</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>LINQPad exposes a new extensiblity model that lets you offer first-class support
			for third-party ORMs and other querying sources. Visit <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/Extensibility.aspx">
				http://www.linqpad.net/Extensibility.aspx</a> for information on writing a driver.</li>
		<li>You can now query WCF Data Services as easily as a database. Click 'Add Connection'
			and then click the 'Data Services' radio button.</li>
		<li>SQL Azure is now fully supported. Just click the 'Azure' radio button in the connection
			dialog.</li>
		<li>A single-click plugin is available to query SQLite and MySQL Enterprise/Community
			servers via the IQToolkit. To download, click 'Add Connection', and then click 'View
			more drivers'.</li>
		<li>LINQPad now lets you specify an arbitrary provider and connection string when connecting
			to an Entity Framework EDM. This means you can use third-party EF providers that
			support other databases such as Oracle or Sqlite.</li>
		<li>SQL CE databases larger than 256MB are now supported via an option on the Connection
			dialog.</li>
		<li>There's now a button to the right of 'Results' that exports results into Excel or
			Word - with or without formatting.</li>
		<li>With queries that Dump multiple result sets or values, LINQPad now displays data
			in the output window as soon as it becomes available.</li>
		<li>You can now define extension methods in queries of type 'C# Program'. Just write
			a static class below the Main method with the desired extension methods.</li>
		<li>There's a new 'Find All' option on the Edit menu that searches all queries and samples.</li>
		<li>You can inject hyperlinks into the output by instantiating the new Hyperlinq class.
			You can populate a Hyperlinq with either an ordinary URL or a query that will execute
			in another window when clicked.</li>
		<li>You can create additional DataContexts of the same schema by instantiating the UserQuery
			class, passing in a new connection or connection string.</li>
		<li>There's now a 'Close all connections' option on the Connection context menu. This
			is handy when you want to drop a database.</li>
		<li>LINQPad supports SSL connections to SQL Server via a new checkbox on the connection
			dialog.</li>
		<li>On the Edit menu, there's a new 'Execute Shell Command' option which inserts a calls
			a helper method that lets you easily execute operating system commands. The output
			is returned as an array of lines, and is written to LINQPad's output window.</li>
		<li>In Edit | Preferences, there's a new Advanced tab with more customization options,
			including options for editor tabs and column widths.</li>
		<li>Performance has improved considerably with very large schemas (more than 1000 tables).</li>
		<li>The System.Transactions assembly + namespace is now automatically imported.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Version 1.35</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>LINQPad now provides first-class support for 1:1 relationships and single-character
			columns. This means that references now appear on both sides of 1:1 relationships
			(rather than an EntitySet) and CHAR(1) / NVARCHAR(1) columns map to System.Char
			rather than System.String. Because this may break compatibility with previously
			written queries, these enhancements can be turned off globally under Edit | Preferences.</li>
		<li>Custom LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework classes are now supported. This means you
			can query those typed DataContext and ObjectContext classes that you've tweaked
			for hours in Visual Studio - as easily as querying directly against a database.
			Simply click 'Add Connection', and select 'Custom LINQ to SQL DataContext' or 'Custom
			Entity Framework ObjectContext' in the combobox at the top. LINQPad will still display
			full SQL translations for every query - whether it uses LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework.</li>
		<li>With long-running queries, the SQL and lambda translations are now visible immediately
			after starting the query.</li>
		<li>The SQL translation pane now formats the parameters such that the entire query can
			be copied and pasted into SQL Management Studio. And there's a new option to do
			exactly that in one step (under 'Analyze SQL' on the SQL pane). This is useful when
			you want to examine a query's execution plan.</li>
		<li>When using an Entity Framework ObjectContext, you can test Entity-SQL queries by
			selecting ESQL in the language dropdown.</li>
		<li>When you cancel a running LINQ to SQL (or EF) query, LINQPad now tracks down and
			explicitly cancels the associated SqlCommand right away to avoid wasting resources.</li>
		<li>Autocompletion now supports smart tags for importing additional namespaces, autocompletion
			for indexers, and enhanced functionality when assigning and comparing enum values.</li>
		<li>You can now edit stored procedures, functions and views within LINQPad (right-click
			on the object in the TreeView).</li>
		<li>LINQPad now formats 2-dimensional arrays of simple element types nicely in matrix
			form.</li>
		<li>A number of bugs have been fixed, including a memory leak causing queries not to
			release memory when closed.</li>
		<li>There's now a MRU on the File menu and several new keyboard shortcuts - see 'Keyboard
			Shortcuts' on the Help menu for a complete list.</li>
		<li>Unsafe code blocks are now supported when querying in C#.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Version 1.32</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The query 'language' dropdown now includes two new options: 'C# Program' and 'VB
			Program'. These serve a similar role to 'C# Statements' and 'VB Statements' except
			that they also let you write additional methods and classes.</li>
		<li>LINQPad now supports SQL Compact Edition.</li>
		<li>The results pane now has a new tab that shows the IL translation of your queries
			or C#/VB code snippets.</li>
		<li>LINQPad now displays totals of numeric result columns, and simple graphs if you
			click the ≡ symbol on the column header.</li>
		<li>Autocompletion now supports object creation and object initialization expressions.</li>
		<li>The autocompletion cache automatically refreshes itself when you rebuild referenced
			assemblies.</li>
		<li>Under Edit | Preferences, you can increase the maximum number of rows returned in
			a single query (up to 10,000) and set the default query language to something other
			than C# Expression.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Previous Enhancements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>LINQPad now supports autocompletion for C# queries, as an optional feature. <a
			href="http://www.linqpad.net/Purchase.aspx">Click here</a> for details.</li>
		<li>Middle-clicking a query in My Queries or Sample Queries forces the query to open
			in a new tab.</li>
		<li>LINQPad has a new mode for supporting cordless presenters - see the FAQ on the Help
			menu for details.</li>
